# data-structures-algorithms
The repository includes implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, along with a range of algorithms such as sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (linear search, binary search), and graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm).
